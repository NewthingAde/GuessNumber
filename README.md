## GuessNumber
In the repository I have two different challenge, the first is Task1 and the second is task2.


## task1
The task1 is a conversion susyem whcich Select which currency that SEK should be converted to (for example Euro). 
Then use a search engine to find the current exchange rate between SEK and that currency.


## task1
The task2 is a guessingnumber game. The user should guess which number the computer is “thinking of”. 
The computer should randomize a number between 1 and 100. Every time the user answers wrong, the program should tell the user if the correct number is higher or lower than the guess.
